# algebraic_cryptanalysis

## main goal

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the most widely used symmetric encryption method today and no attack known to date is effective enough to undermine this cryptosystem. An interesting approach consists in calculating the Gröbner basis of the polynomial system associated with the encryption process. Once calculated, the result obtained is correct and allows to find the clear and the key of encryption. The problem with this method is that it is much too long to calculate on practical cases, which makes it unusable.

The goal of this introspective project of algebraic cryptanalysis on AES is to seek and find ways of improving Gröbner bases to reduce complexity.
